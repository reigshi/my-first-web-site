<p>These iconic rain-forest amphibians sleep by day stuck to leaf-bottoms with their eyes closed and body markings covered. 
<strong>When <u>disturbed</u>,</strong> they flash their bulging red eyes and reveal their huge, 
webbed orange feet and bright blue-and-yellow flanks. This technique, called startle coloration, 
may give a bird or snake pause, offering a precious instant for the frog to spring to safety.
</p><img src="frog.jpg" width="100%"><p style="margin-top:40px;">Their neon-green bodies may play a similar role in thwarting predators. Many of the animals that
eat red-eyed tree frogs are nocturnal hunters that use keen eyesight to find prey. The shocking 
colors of this frog may over-stimulate a predator's eyes, creating a confusing ghost image that 
remains behind as the frog jumps away.</p>
